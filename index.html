        <h2>About EcoVista</h2>
      
        <p>
          EcoVista is a next-generation smart waste management platform built to tackle the growing sanitation challenges in urban environments. Overflowing bins, improper disposal, and lack of public awareness have long plagued our cities. EcoVista transforms this broken system into a smart, efficient, and community-driven ecosystem.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          At its core, EcoVista leverages the power of AI and real-time data to make waste management smarter. Our <strong>TrashScan</strong> tool uses machine learning to help users identify the correct way to dispose of their waste—organic, recyclable, or hazardous. <strong>BinSense</strong> enables continuous monitoring of public bins to ensure timely waste collection. With <strong>PredictBin</strong>, we forecast bin overflow using historical patterns, helping municipalities optimize collection routes and schedules.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          But EcoVista goes beyond infrastructure—it puts people at the center. Through our <strong>EcoPoints</strong> system, users are rewarded for proper waste disposal by scanning QR codes on smart bins. <strong>CleanConnect</strong> empowers citizens to report issues like overflowing bins or unclean areas directly to local authorities, bridging the gap between the community and the municipal systems.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Administrators can access <strong>WasteWatch</strong>, a powerful dashboard that visualizes bin status, alerts, and user-reported issues in real-time. This data-driven approach leads to faster responses, better planning, and cleaner cities.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          EcoVista aligns with <strong>Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities)</strong> by promoting responsible consumption, reducing waste-related pollution, and enhancing civic engagement. Our mission is simple: build cleaner, smarter, and more sustainable cities where technology and people work hand-in-hand for a better tomorrow.
        </p>
      
        <h3>
          EcoVista is more than an app or a dashboard—it's a movement toward conscious urban living. Join us as we clean up our cities, one smart bin at a time.

            <p><strong>EcoVista</strong> is built as a modular, AI-driven system that seamlessly connects users, bins, and municipal authorities through an integrated digital infrastructure.</p>
            
            <p>At the front, users interact via a web/mobile app powered by <strong>TrashScan</strong> for AI waste classification and <strong>EcoPoints</strong> for QR-based rewards. Meanwhile, <strong>BinSense</strong> sensors send real-time bin data to the backend using Firebase Realtime Database.</p>
      
            <p>Our <strong>PredictBin</strong> engine forecasts bin overflows using historical trends. <strong>CleanConnect</strong> enables citizen issue reporting, while administrators monitor everything through the <strong>WasteWatch Dashboard</strong> — complete with data visualizations, alerts, and maps.</p>
      
            <p>The system leverages Teachable Machine (AI), Firebase (backend), Chart.js (visuals), and Google Maps API (location mapping) — making EcoVista scalable, interactive, and efficient.</p>
